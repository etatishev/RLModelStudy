## RL MODEL STUDY
Written June 9th, 2025 as a final project for Dartmouths "Computational Models of Behavior" for the purpose of learning more about RL models and methods in computational models of behavior. 

Using Eckstein et al.'s (2022) "Reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference provide complementary models for the unique 
advantage of adolescents in stochastic reversal" for reference and for their publicly available rodent behavioral data.
